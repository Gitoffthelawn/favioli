Favioli is a tool for overriding Favicons for websites.

## Development

You need to download [Deno](https://deno.land/) in order to build this app.

After, we want to install [bext](https://github.com/bpevs/bext):

```sh
deno install --name=bext --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run --allow-env -f https://deno.land/x/bext/main.ts
```

| Commands         | What they Do                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `bext`           | bundles extension and watch code    |
| `bext chrome`    | bundles extension only for chrome   |
| `bext firefox`   | bundles extension only for firefox  |
| `deno task test` | run code formatter, then unit tests |

If you have bundled using make commands, you should be able to load your
unpacked extension using a browser.

This will build our distribution code into `/dist`, each browser with its own
directory. To load Favioli, point to each browser's respective directory.
[Google](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) and
[Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons) each have
resources about developing for their respective platforms.
